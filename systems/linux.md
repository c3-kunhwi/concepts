### Kernel
---
##### Driver
```
Code that runs in the kernel to communicate with hardware device.
```

##### Module
```
Code that can extend the behavior of the kernel and be removed on demand. 
```

### Networking
---
##### Netfilter
```
a) Netfilter is a Linux network framework for packet filtering, NAT creation, and packet modification.
b) Netfilter represents a set of hooks in the Linux kernel.
   As packets traverse the network stack of the kernel, they will traverse through individual hooks.
c) Netfilter allows users to write modules and register callback functions to individual hooks.
   When hooks are triggered, callback functions will be triggered. 
```

##### Netfilter Hooks
```
NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING
  a) Triggered by incoming traffic soon after entering the network stack.
  b) Triggered before any routing decisions are made.

NF_IP_LOCAL_IN
  a) Triggered for packets that are destined for the current host.

NF_IP_FORWARD
  a) Triggered for packets that need to be forwarded.

NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT
  a) Triggered for outbound traffic generated by the current host.

NF_IP_POST_ROUTING
  a) Triggered for outgoing traffic after routing but before being sent out on the wire.
```

##### IPTable
```
a) IPTable is a firewall tool that interacts with kernel hooks from the Netfilter framework.  
```

##### IPTable Tables
```
Filter Table
  a) This table is used to decide whether to accept or deny a packet to its intended destination.

NAT Table
  a) This table is used to implement NAT rules.
  b) This table is used to determine whether and how to modify the packet's source and destination addresses.

Mangle Table
  a) This table is used to alter the IP headers of packets (e.g. TTL values, number of network hops to sustain etc.).

Raw Table
  a) IPTables is a stateful firewall that inspects packets in relation to previous packets.
     Connection tracking features from Netfilter enables IPTables to view packets as part of an ongoing session. 
     This table is used to exempt packets from connection tracking or allow users to work with packets before state is tracked.

Security Table
  a) This table is used to set SELinux security context onto packets.
```

### Resource Allocation
---
##### Control Groups (cgroups)
```
Linux kernel feature that limits, isolates, and monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O, network) of a collection of processes.
```
