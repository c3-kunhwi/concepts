##### Orchestration 
```
Orchestration deals with certain problems:
    1. How do we automate container life cycles?
    2. How can we easily make our service scalable?
    3. How do we make our system fault tolerant and replace containers without downtime?
    4. How can we ensure containers run on trusted servers?
    5. How can we deal with security issues?
