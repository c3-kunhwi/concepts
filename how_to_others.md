### Object Oriented Programming
---
##### Inheritance
```
parent class : Dog 
child class : Retriever 

child class can inherit all data fields and methods of parent class, while defining its own fields or methods 

Advantages : 
  1) Reusability : Do not have to write already existing lines of code 
```

##### Polymorphism
```
Triangle shape = new Triangle() 
Shape shape = new Triangle()           class triangle is a part of class shape (polymorphism)
Shape shape = new Circle()             class circle is a part of class shape 
Triangle shape = new Shape()           a triangle is a shape, but a shape is not a triangle (invalid)

public void run(Shape shape) {}        classes shape, triangle, and circle and all be passed to the parameter

Advantages :
  1) Flexibility 
```

##### Dependency Injection 
```
Suppose you have a class car and you must also instantiate classes wheel, company, material

class Car {
  Company company = new Company("Audi");
}

Wheel, company, and material are 'dependencies' of car because car uses these classes

What if we want to create multiple objects of car, but with different wheels, companies, and materials?

Instead of instantiating and setting dependencies within the class, one can create a dependency from the outside 

This exterior dependency (e.g. wheel) can then be injected into the class car  

Advantages :
  1) Makes testing easier as dependency classes do not have to be instantiated 
  2) Allows for independent development of classes 
  3) Can easily switch out different dependencies to the class 
  4) Can use the dependencies in other classes 
```

##### Object Relational Mapping
```
Maps class objects to relational database 
```
